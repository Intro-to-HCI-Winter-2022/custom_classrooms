# Custom Classrooms

### Why Custom Classrooms?
Our platform seeks to revolutionize the online classroom experience. First, our app gives the professor the unique ability to set up their own unique custom arrangement of cameras on a video call, a custom classroom. Then, it gives the student the agency to choose the placement of their Zoom camera. In doing so, we seek to mimic the real life familiarity and comfort of choosing and having your own seat. In addition to this, we give the student a more social experience by allowing them to interact and socialize with other classmates' avatars in an optional 2d game view. With these features, we hope to bring a little bit more humanity into the online classroom experience. 

Context: This project is the product of several rounds of interviews with professors and students. We wanted to build a product that addressed a clear need we found in these interviews. This need being the lack of humanity and sociability in the online classroom environment. 

### Check out the Figma Design it's really fleshed out! 
There are multiple branching pathes so click everything! Specifically there are different paths for "Log-in" and "Join a Classroom". IMPORTANT: To go forward on a few of the slides you must Click AND Drag the button/image!
